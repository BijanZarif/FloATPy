FloATPy (Flow Physics and Aeroacoustics Toolbox with Python) is a post-processing toolbox for the numerical codes in the FPAL (Flow Physics and Aeroacoustics Laboratory) at Stanford University.

### How do I get set up? ###

To set up the code, you can use the following command:

`python setup.py install`

If you don't have root access, you can do:

`python setup.py install --user`

### Contribution guidelines ###

Pleas put all tests in the `floatpy/tests` directory. Tests are required for every module in the package. Please see the [coding style](https://github.com/mlwong/FloATPy/wiki/Coding-Style) for adding new modules to the toolbox and [testing directives](https://github.com/mlwong/FloATPy/wiki/Testing-Directives) to add the corresponding tests.

### Who do I talk to? ###

You can talk to Man-Long Wong (wongml@stanford.edu) or Akshay Subramaniam (akshays@stanford.edu).
